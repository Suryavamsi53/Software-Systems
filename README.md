2. **Identification**: How to spot this pattern (keywords like "contiguous", "sorted", "shortest path").
3. **Visual Explanation**: ASCII diagrams, flowcharts, and mental models.
4. **Step-by-step Dry Run**: Tracing the algorithm with variables.
5. **Common Mistakes**: Edge cases and pitfalls.

- ✅ Deep concepts (not memorization)
- ✅ Why > How (reasoning before coding)
- ✅ Interview-realistic (what Company actually asks)
- ✅ Scalable thinking (works for 10^5 inputs)

## 👨‍💻 Interview Pro Tips

1. **Clarify first** - Ask about constraints, edge cases, input ranges
2. **Brute force before optimization** - Show your thought process
3. **Complexity always** - State time & space upfront
4. **Code & explain** - Don't stay silent while coding
5. **Test with examples** - Walk through small inputs
6. **Handle edge cases** - Empty input, single element, duplicates
7. **Ask about trade-offs** - Time vs space, simplicity vs efficiency

---

## 🌐 Self-Hosted Note

This is intentionally self-hosted (no cloud dependency) because:
- ✅ You own your data
- ✅ Works offline after first load
- ✅ Instant access (no latency)
- ✅ Can be shared privately
- ✅ Perfect for daily revision loop

---

## 📞 Support

This is a personal study tool. For issues:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify all HTML files are in correct folders
3. Use Python's `python -m http.server` for serving

---

## 💡 Why This Exists

Most interview prep is generic or memorization-based. Real interviews at Company require:
- **Pattern recognition** (immediate identification)
- **Deep reasoning** (why this approach)
- **Real-world context** (business impact)
- **System thinking** (scale, constraints, trade-offs)

This guide fills that gap. 🚀
