## 🚀 Get Started in 30 Seconds

### Step 1: Navigate to the Project
```bash
cd /home/suryavamsivaggu/Amazon/amazon-coding-patterns
```

### Step 2: Start a Local Server
Choose ONE option:

**Option A: Python (Easiest)**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Option B: Node.js (if you have it)**
```bash
npx http-server
```

**Option C: VS Code Live Server**
- Open `index.html` in VS Code
- Right-click → "Open with Live Server"

### Step 3: Open in Browser
- Go to: `http://localhost:8000`
- You should see the dark-themed dashboard

---

## 📱 What You'll See

1. **Left Sidebar** - All 18 DSA patterns organized by category
2. **Main Content** - Currently shows welcome page with study tips
3. **Dark Theme** - Navy background (#0f172a) with green/blue/yellow/red callouts
4. **Navigation** - Click any pattern in sidebar to study

## 🎯 First Study Session

### Recommended: 30 minutes

1. **Read the intro** (5 min)
   - Click on main content area
   - Understand why patterns matter

2. **Study Two Pointers** (20 min)
   - Click "Two Pointers" in sidebar
   - Read "What Amazon Expects" (green section)
   - Read "Canonical Problem" (Container With Most Water)
   - Review the Go solution
   - Read "Walkthrough" table

3. **Check what you learned** (5 min)
   - Can you explain Two Pointers to a friend?
   - Do you understand "why move the shorter pointer"?

---

## 🎓 Pattern Study Template

**For ANY pattern, follow this 30-min routine:**

1. ✅ **Amazon Expects** (2 min)
   - What's the interviewer checking?
   - What complexity do they want?

2. 🧠 **Core Concept** (3 min)
   - When does this pattern apply?
   - Recognition keywords?

3. 🎯 **Real-World** (2 min)
   - How does Amazon use this?
   - Business context?

4. 🖼️ **Visual** (3 min)
   - Understand the movement
   - See the state changes

5. 🧩 **Canonical Problem** (5 min)
   - What's the classic question?
   - What makes it tricky?

6. 🟢 **Optimized Code** (7 min)
   - Read the Go solution
   - Understand each line
   - Trace through example

7. 🧩 **Walkthrough** (3 min)
   - See the step-by-step trace
   - Understand the loop behavior

## 🌟 Two Fully-Done Patterns (Reference)

Study these as templates for all other patterns:

### 1. Two Pointers
- **File**: `/patterns/two-pointers.html`
- **Problem**: Container With Most Water
- **Key**: Why move the shorter pointer?

### 2. Sliding Window
- **File**: `/patterns/sliding-window.html`
- **Problem**: Minimum Window Substring
- **Key**: Fixed vs. dynamic window

## 💾 Tracking Your Progress

The site saves automatically:
- Which patterns you've studied
- How many times you visited each page
- Which sections you've expanded

**Check progress in browser console:**
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// Type: getStudyStats()
// See your study history
```

---

## 🎯 7-Day Study Plan

### Day 1: Fundamentals
- **Morning (30 min)**: Two Pointers
- **Evening (30 min)**: Sliding Window

### Day 2-3: Search Patterns
- **Morning**: Binary Search
- **Evening**: Hash Maps & Sets

### Day 4-5: Data Structures
- **Morning**: Linked Lists + Stack
- **Afternoon**: Trees + Heaps

### Day 6-7: Advanced
- **Morning**: Graphs + DFS/BFS
- **Afternoon**: Dynamic Programming + Backtracking

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Page shows no content"
- Make sure server is running (`python -m http.server 8000`)
- Refresh browser (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- Check console for errors (F12)

### "Sidebar navigation doesn't work"
- Wait for page to fully load
- Click on sidebar items slowly
- Check if JavaScript is enabled

### "Styles look wrong"
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache

## 🎬 Next Steps After Quick Start

1. **Complete 3-Week Curriculum**
   - Study one pattern daily
   - 30-min deep dives on weekends
   - Code all canonical problems

2. **Practice Problems**
   - Use LeetCode, HackerRank
   - Search for problems by pattern name
   - Implement in Go

3. **Mock Interviews**
   - Find a partner or use interviewing.io
   - Practice for 1 hour at a time
   - Explain your thinking aloud

4. **System Design** (After SDE-1 patterns)
   - Review system design patterns
   - Practice API design, database selection
   - Think in terms of scale

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### ✅ DO:
- Study ONE pattern deeply instead of many shallow
- Implement from SCRATCH without looking
- Explain aloud like you're in a real interview
- Test edge cases before claiming it works
- Ask follow-up questions to yourself

### ❌ DON'T:
- Memorize code (understand logic)
- Copy-paste solutions (type them)
- Skip the "Why" sections
- Study late night before interview
- Ignore edge cases
